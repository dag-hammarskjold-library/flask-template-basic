# Basic Flask Template for Zappa Deployment
This template is an empty Flask application you can use to build your own application. It assumes you are going to use Git for source version control and deploy to Amazon's API Gateway and Lambda services. What it does not assume is that you have all the resouces already setup for use.

To use this template, you will want to clone, fork, or otherwise copy the code to your own development space. Each file included here contains brief comments on how to use it, but much of this is also covered here in the README.

First, let's look at the application structure. This README assumes you've named your application "app". You can rename the application by moving the "app" folder to something you've named, but it's really a superficial item and is unnecessary.
