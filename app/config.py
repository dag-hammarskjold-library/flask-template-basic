'''
This is your application configuration file. Use it to set your various configurations,
but DO NOT put credentials in this file because this file may be checked in to a public
repository.

Acceptable means of storing/accessing credentials:
  - AWS Parameter Store, e.g.:

        import boto3
        client = boto3.client('ssm')
        username = client.get_parameter(Name='username')['Parameter']['Value']
        password = client.get_parameter(Name='password')['Parameter']['Value']

    Obviously you need to have the desired parameters already stored in Parameter Store, and you
    should have the awscli installed and configured with a key id and secret key supplied by AWS 
    or your AWS administrator.

  - Environment variables:

        import os
        username = os.environ.get('username')
        password = os.environ.get('password')

Note that if you use environment variables and plan to incorporate a CI/CD pipeline, e.g., with 
Travis CI, you will need to make sure your CI environment has the appropriate variables defined
and stored.
